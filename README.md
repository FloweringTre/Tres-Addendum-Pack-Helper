<h2><i>Tre's Adendeusadkmmeum Pack Helper</i></h2> 
<img src="./assets/icon.png" alt="Helper Pack Logo" width="30"/> This new application is designed to make resource packs for the swem-addendum mod. It will also produce a .txt document with summon commands.
<br><br>
This software will produce the resource pack complete with textures (that you select from your computer).
